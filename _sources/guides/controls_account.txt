Bash Shell Setup
----------------

The BASH shell is initialized by two main files `.bashrc` and `.bash_profile`.
These are executed by the shell differently depending on how the shell is
executed. This is often a source of confusion. These files are summarized below:

* `.bashrc` : This is run by *interactive* shells. These are shells that are connected to a
  terminal (or pseudo-terminal) such as a `xterm` running under a windowing
  system.  
  
* `.bash_profile` : This is run by *login* shells. These are shells
  that are started when you login from another host or you login from the text
  terminal on a local machine.
