UNIX Account Setup
==================

Bash Shell Setup
----------------

The BASH shell is initialized by two main files ``.bashrc`` and ``.bash_profile``.
These are executed by the shell differently depending on how the shell is
executed. This is often a source of confusion. These files are summarized below:

* ``.bashrc`` : This is run by *interactive* shells. These are shells that are
  connected to a terminal (or pseudo-terminal) such as a `xterm` running under
  a windowing system.  
  
* ``.bash_profile`` : This is run by *login* shells. These are shells
  that are started when you login from another host or you login from the text
  terminal on a local machine. 

BASH is also different from other shells in that ``.bashrc`` and ``.bash_profile``
are *mutually exclusive* (i.e. only one is run on the shell startup). To get
round this problem, most people place teh following in the ``.bash_profile`` so
that the shell is initialized the same way for both *interactive* and *login*
shells:

.. code:: bash

    if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
        source ~/.bashrc
    fi

Groups and Permissions
----------------------

UNIX uses the **umask** to define how (new) files permissions are set. This can
be set on a per-user basis using the ``umask`` command to set the default (allowed) 
permissions. The ``umask`` command uses the `octal file notation`_ the same as ``chmod``
