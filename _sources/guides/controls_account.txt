Bash Shell Setup
----------------

The BASH shell is initialized by two main files `.bashrc` and `.bash_profile`.
These are executed by the shell differently depending on how the shell is
executed. This is often a source of confusion. These files are summarized below:

* `.bashrc` : This is run by *interactive* shells. These are shells that are connected to a
  terminal (or pseudo-terminal) such as a `xterm` running under a windowing
  system.  
  
* `.bash_profile` : This is run by *login* shells. These are shells
  that are started when you login from another host or you login from the text
  terminal on a local machine. 

BASH is also different from other shells in that `.bashrc` and `.bash_profile` are *mutually exclusive* (i.e. only one is run on the shell startup). To get round this problem, most people place teh following in the `.bash_profile` so that the shell is initialized the same way for both *interactive* and *login* shells. 

.. code:: bash
    if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
        source ~/.bashrc
    fi
