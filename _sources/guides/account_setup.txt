Controls Account Setup Guide
============================

Introduction
------------

NSLS-II controls accounts allow access to all computers at CSX. Once a new
account has been created, the following is suggested to get the account working
correctly. 

Firstly, all accounts are created with global read permissions. If this is OK
by you then skip the next step. However, if you want to restict access to files
in your home directory then do the following: ::

    [swilkins@xf23id1-srv2 ~ ]$ chmod o-rwx,g-w+rx,u+rwx /home/<uid>
