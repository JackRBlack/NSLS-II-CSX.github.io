Installing Linxbrew
===================

Introduction
------------

`Linuxbrew <http://brew.sh/linuxbrew/>`_ is a package manager for linux which
can be used to have a local installation of such utilities such as ``git``,
``gist`` and ``tmux``. It is especially useful to get around systems which have
relatively out of date core utilities (not looking at you debian). As it
doesn't need superuser privilages it can be installed in a home directory for
example.  

Installing

userspace. To do this: ::
